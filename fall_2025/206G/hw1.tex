\section{1}

for defenders there are no dominated strategies.
note for offense that turnover is totally dominated by field goal. 

there are no pure nash equilibria. touchdown s/n are symmetric, and switching from field goal to td is not strictly better; the inverse is also not strictly better. 

let the probability of defenders to defend north to be \(a\) and defend south to be \(b\). let the probability of offense to td north be \(p\), td south be \(q\) and field goal be \(r\). 

\[r = 1-p-q\]

thus the payoff for attackers is:
